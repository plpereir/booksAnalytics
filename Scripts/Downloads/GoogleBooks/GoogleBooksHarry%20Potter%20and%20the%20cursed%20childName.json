    "description": "Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play received its world premiere in London’s West End on 30th July 2016. It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.",

It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places. The playscript for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was originally released as a 'special rehearsal edition' alongside the opening of Jack Thorne's play in London's West End in summer 2016. Based on an original story by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany and Jack Thorne, the play opened to rapturous reviews from theatregoers and critics alike, while the official playscript became an immediate global bestseller. This definitive and final playscript updates the 'special rehearsal edition' with the conclusive and final dialogue from the play, which has subtly changed since its rehearsals, as well as a conversation piece between director John Tiffany and writer Jack Thorne, who share stories and insights about reading playscripts. This edition also includes useful background information including the Potter family tree and a timeline of events from the Wizarding World prior to the beginning of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.",

The entire Potter Mania world rejoiced when news came out that British author, J.K. Rowling, is all set to surprise them with another incredible story. The revelation that a stage play based on Harry Potter is underway was earlier made in December, 2013. The upcoming stage play was officially confirmed on the 18th anniversary of the UK publication of the first \"Harry Potter\" book, 26 June 2015. The play titled \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" is the eighth part of the Harry Potter series and scripted by the J.K Rowling in collaboration with John Tiffany, who will direct the production and Jack Thorne, who has written the resulting play. It will be staged in two parts- I and II. Part I and II are intended to be seen in order on the same day (matinee and evening) or on two consecutive evenings. The Potter fans, desperately waiting for another story (I being one of them), went crazy with delight when confirmation came that it is the official sequel to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows as the eighth story of the series on October 23, 2015. It would receive its official world premiere on Saturday, 30 July 2016 at Palace Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue London (Image Right), on the 20th anniversary of the UK publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

    "description": "The official behind-the-scenes book of the record-breaking, award-winning play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is one of the most celebrated stage productions of the past decade. Opening in London's West End in 2016, on Broadway in 2018, in Melbourne in 2019 -- and with more productions worldwide still to come (including San Francisco later this year) -- the play has smashed records, collected countless rave reviews and awards, and captivated audiences night after night. Now readers are invited behind the scenes to experience the show's journey to the stage -- from the earliest phases of development with producers Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, to the crafting of the eighth Harry Potter story with J.K. Rowling, director John Tiffany, and playwright Jack Thorne, to the gathering of an extraordinary team of artists and actors together to bring this new part of Harry Potter's story to life. With stunning photography, insightful interviews, and never-before-seen sketches, notes, candid backstage photos, and more, this full-color deluxe edition offers readers unparalleled access to this unique production, and is a beautiful gift for Harry Potter fans and theater-lovers alike.",

In this new parody, meant for both children and adults, we finally get the sequel to the epic series: Will Elbows and Scorpio succeed in changing the past? When Scorpio accidentally ends up in an alternate reality where the Dark Lord won, and he's the coolest kid in school, will he go back again to undo what they undid? Or will he stick around, go on a date with Holly Chapstick . . . and decide this new reality is actually pretty dope?",
