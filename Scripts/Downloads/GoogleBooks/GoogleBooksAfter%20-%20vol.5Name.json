    "description": "Com este volume, que reúne os dois últimos livros (III e IV) de 'Finnegans Wake', o tradutor chega ao fim de seu árduo Work in Progress. Quatro capítulos (13, 14, 15 e 16) compõem o livro III, no qual assistimos ao show heteronímico de Shaun (o gêmeo reverso de Shem), que como personagem central dessa série, passa por sucessivas transformações em vários outros de si mesmo. O capítulo 17, também conhecido como ricorso, ocupa todo o livro IV. Nele ecoam os temas de todos os outros capítulos. Sua função é evidenciar o caráter cíclico, 'viconiano', da obra, visto que termina exatamente no meio de uma frase que, por sua vez, se liga à primeira do capítulo inicial. Com notas de leitura que acompanham a tradução deste último capítulo, Donaldo oferece aos leitores de língua portuguesa uma versão integral e, de alto nível, do prodigioso 'nightmaze' de 'Finnicius Revém'.",

    "description": "LEARN SPANISH NEWS Vol.5: English & Spanish THIS EDITION: The dual-language text has been arranged into sentences and shorter paragraphs for quick and easy cross-referencing. The source text is the Spanish language edition of Voice of America (VOA). The Spanish text has been translated into English for this dual-language project. The reader can choose between four formats: Section 1: English to Spanish Section 2: Spanish to English Section 3: English Section 4: Spanish A methodology for getting the most out of this bilingual format is explained in the book’s Foreword. The primary purpose of this text is to equip a foreign language learner with the ability to start reading news in the particular foreign language: to be able to read only in the foreign language, and extract enough understanding to continue the language learning process fruitfully this way. A reader might like to go back to reading dual-language news for reinforcement and further development, returning to foreign language only news with a deeper understanding. By going back to the same ‘old’ news, you are going over words, word patterns, and passages with which you already have a certain familiarity. The process of reinforcement, learning or retaining of what is new, and exposure to what is unfamiliar, is much easier this way — even though the news may seem a little dated. The aim of informing the reader about actual news is secondary, especially given that the content will become less current (and less relevant) over time. If you are having trouble with the level of difficulty in the text, a suggested path for learning languages is as follows: Familiarise yourself with a basic language instruction book — or re-read the one you have. Once a student has studied the basics, a suitable book about basic grammar can be helpful. The suggestion is that any grammar book be studied more with the intent of recognition and understanding, rather than memorising and obsessive rote learning. Go through as much of the grammar book you feel you can digest — maybe even the whole book — skipping over what is not easily understood. After this, read through a portion of text in a book called ‘Spanish Sentences’, by 2LanguageBooks, looking for examples of what you have picked up (or gleaned) in your hopefully not so arduous study of grammar. Even repeatedly seeing a word that you remember seeing listed as a ‘subject pronoun’ or a ‘third person plural’ verb of some sort is a great help. Then, depending on your inclination, return to the grammar book (or your basic Spanish book), or move on to lengthier bilingual text — like in 2Language Books texts containing news or stories, for example —, or find some suitable Spanish text: a simple novel, a Spanish news website, etc. Grammar books will likely have some verb charts. However, there are currently good on-line resources that go further — dictionaries with a verb conjugation ‘search’ option. Many basic language books offer some form of audio support. Internet services — primarily news based radio stations — offer podcasts. Audio from television is an additional resource, and can be formatted for use on various digital platforms. However, if audio is an important component of your interest in languages, electronic devices that support quality text-to-speech (TTS) will likely be appealing. With a library card, TTS technology (in a device that supports the relevant content), and the above mentioned resources, an entire language learning system is available for not much more than a cup of coffee!

    "description": "LEARN FRENCH NEWS Vol.5: English & French THIS EDITION: The dual-language text has been arranged into sentences and shorter paragraphs for quick and easy cross-referencing. The source text is the French language edition of Voice of America (VOA). The French text has been translated into English for this dual-language project. The reader can choose between four formats: Section 1: English to French Section 2: French to English Section 3: English Section 4: French A methodology for getting the most out of this bilingual format is explained in the book’s Foreword. The primary purpose of this text is to equip a foreign language learner with the ability to start reading news in the particular foreign language: to be able to read only in the foreign language, and extract enough understanding to continue the language learning process fruitfully this way. A reader might like to go back to reading dual-language news for reinforcement and further development, returning to foreign language only news with a deeper understanding. By going back to the same ‘old’ news, you are going over words, word patterns, and passages with which you already have a certain familiarity. The process of reinforcement, learning or retaining of what is new, and exposure to what is unfamiliar, is much easier this way — even though the news may seem a little dated. The aim of informing the reader about actual news is secondary, especially given that the content will become less current (and less relevant) over time. If you are having trouble with the level of difficulty in the text, a suggested path for learning languages is as follows: Familiarise yourself with a basic language instruction book — or re-read the one you have. Once a student has studied the basics, a suitable book about basic grammar can be helpful. The suggestion is that any grammar book be studied more with the intent of recognition and understanding, rather than memorising and obsessive rote learning. Go through as much of the grammar book you feel you can digest — maybe even the whole book — skipping over what is not easily understood. After this, read through a portion of text in a book called ‘French Sentences’, by 2LanguageBooks, looking for examples of what you have picked up (or gleaned) in your hopefully not so arduous study of grammar. Even repeatedly seeing a word that you remember seeing listed as a ‘subject pronoun’ or a ‘third person plural’ verb of some sort is a great help. Then, depending on your inclination, return to the grammar book (or your basic French book), or move on to lengthier bilingual text — like in 2Language Books texts containing news or stories, for example —, or find some suitable French text: a simple novel, a French news website, etc. Grammar books will likely have some verb charts. However, there are currently good on-line resources that go further — dictionaries with a verb conjugation ‘search’ option. Many basic language books offer some form of audio support. Internet services — primarily news based radio stations — offer podcasts. Audio from television is an additional resource, and can be formatted for use on various digital platforms. However, if audio is an important component of your interest in languages, electronic devices that support quality text-to-speech (TTS) will likely be appealing. With a library card, TTS technology (in a device that supports the relevant content), and the above mentioned resources, an entire language learning system is available for not much more than a cup of coffee! There is no substantial financial outlay to get you started. Furthermore, there are no additional ongoing fees (and updates), and there are no expiry dates on ‘premium’ content and resources.

The Editorial Office of the Yearbook is in the central building of the International Strategic Research Organization (USAK) in Ankara, Turkey. However, the Yearbook is an independent publication in terms of scholarly research and the editors decide its publication policies. Esteemed academics dispassionately evaluate all submitted articles to ensure their conformity with academic rules and formats. While the focal points of published articles converge on international relations, international law and political science, essentially; subjects regarding Area studies of the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe are also spared considerable space. Additionally, pieces concerning international security, sociology, and anthropological studies are also regularly included in the Yearbook. Now entering its sixth year of compilation, the Yearbook provides a scholarly platform for academics and researchers throughout the world. The USAK Yearbook of Politics and International Relations is gifted to every dual subscriber to the Review of International Law and Politics (UHP) and the Journal of Central Asia and the Caucasus (OAKA) after their first year of subscription. Indexes through which our followers can browse and access Yearbook are as follows: Hein Online, International Political Science Abstracts (IPSA), PAIS International, CSA Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, CSA Sociological Abstracts, CSA Social Services Abstracts and ULAKBİM.",

Wagaduthe Soninke name of the Ghana Empirecontrolled the present-day Mali, Mauritania and Senegal and was famous for its prosperity and power from approximately 300-1076 CE. It constituted the bridge between North Africa, the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern worlds and Sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana gave birth to the two most powerful West African Empires: Mali and Songhay. The modern country of Ghana (former British Gold Coast) derives its name from the Ghana Empire. Why Wagadu? Wagadu has come to be the symbol of the sacrifice women continue to make for a better world. Wagadu has become the metaphor for the role of women in the family, community, country, and planet. In this volume the authors grapple with the intersecting discourses on anti-trafficking, human rights, and social justice, edited by Tiantian Zheng, associate professor of anthropology at SUNY Cortland. Duna taka siro no yagare npale The world does not go without women. Tiantian Zheng is associate professor of Anthropology at SUNY Cortland and author of the forthcoming book _Red Lights: The Lives of Sex Workers in Postsocialist China_, by University of Minnesota Press, in 2009.",
