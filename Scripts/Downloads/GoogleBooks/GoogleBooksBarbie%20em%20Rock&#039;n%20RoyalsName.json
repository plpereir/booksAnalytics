You didn't know it, but there's a secret camp where only the children of royalty are invited to every year. There, they get to make friends with other princes and princesses from kingdoms all over the world and learn the skills required to be a proper princess. Across the lake is Camp Pop, a camp for the children of pop stars. They come to Camp Pop to hone their pop star skills, learning various interments and trying out different musical genres. The two camps have enjoyed a less than friendly rivalry for years. The princesses all sing a capella in a prim and proper way while the pop stars like to rock out with their instruments. This year, due to a clerical error, COURTNEY (Barbie), a princess ends up at the pop star camp and ERIKA, a pop star ends up at the princess camp. While the leaders of each camp attempt to sort it out, both girls are forced to stick it out and soon discover how AWESOME the other camp is.",

    "description": "For Kyle Bishop, making wrong choices was just a way of life. But as a young girl, she had no idea these bad decisions were a direct result of living with bipolar disorder. The life she recounts in Bipolar Barbie is one marked by poor judgment—until a proper diagnosis and medication changed Benson's life. Benson tells of a life filled with chaos. Born of a sixteen-year-old mother into a dysfunctional family, Bishop must cope with her own marriage at age sixteen and divorce just weeks later; six subsequent marriages; a destructive lifestyle of two- or three-day parties; her confinement in a mental institution—and her eventual diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Bipolar Barbie provides an intimate understanding of the disorder's effects, distills the stigma attached to bipolar disorder, and shows that with proper medical treatment, there can be hope for those who are afflicted with this disease.",

    "description": "Beth Curtis, Conqueror of Darkness People tended to pity Kathleen (Beth) Elizabeth Curtis. Most people assumed the thirteen-year-old was a frightened little girl, who could barely function without help. Some even suggested she be locked up in a home because she was totally blind. However, her parents raised her to be as independent as possible. Being blind was no excuse for her not to stretch her limits and do what others considered impossible for her to do. Beth awakens aboard the starship taking her from Earth back to her home world only to discover she is the only one awake on a starship that has been hijacked in mid fight. She levels the playing field by isolating the hijackers and turning off the lights before she goes on a hunt to take out the last of the hijackers. She later becomes a Star Pilot, a crew position that was only used if the navigational computer broke down and could not be repaired because Star Pilots tend to go mad, to save the passengers and the crews aboard her starship, and a second derelict starship.",

    "description": "ROCK BOTTOM BOOK TWO: TRISTAN & DANIKA Their love had the power of a runaway freight train, and the potential to be just as destructive. The tempestuous sequel to Bad Things picks up where the first book left off. Reeling from a profound loss, Tristan and Danika struggle to pick up the pieces and build a life together, but the hard habits of a lifetime are not so easy to escape. Rock Bottom takes us on a dual point of view journey through addiction and desire, through love and agony, and answers the question we’ve been asking since these characters were introduced in Grounded: “What happened between Tristan and Danika?” DANIKA Even love couldn’t cushion a fall like ours. My love for Tristan was so big that I felt consumed by it, and even so, it was not enough to overpower our combined demons. I struggled. I yelled and screamed. I scratched and kicked. I fought like hell, but even the most determined fighters have to stop before they break. No one could say I didn’t fight for him. “I love you,” I spoke softly into his ear. He gripped me harder. “I can’t ever lose you, Danika. I’m not sure I’d survive it.” “You’ve got me. And I’m not going anywhere. Not ever.” I meant the words when I said them, but life had other plans for us. I’d have given my life for that fight. In fact, I very nearly did. TRISTAN She was the one. If I’d ever had a doubt, I didn’t now. She was the one I’d be thinking about, longing for, until I took my last breath. If I lost her tomorrow, I’d pine for her like a lovesick fool. This was the kind of love that only hit you once in your life. This book is intended for readers 18 and up.",
